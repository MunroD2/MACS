<h3> Mental Activities Card Sort (MACS) - Counsellor Instructions</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
	The Mental Activities Card Sort (MACS) is a reflexive decision-making tool
	developed from Margaret Archer's research on internal conversations and
	expanded through research with unpaid female carers considering higher
	education. This activity helps clients visualise and understand the
	complexity of their internal decision-making processes.
</p>
<p>
	Research shows that clients often describe their inner conversations as
	"chaotic," "a big tangled mess," or "scrambled," leaving them feeling
	overwhelmed and unable to see things clearly (Munro et al., 2024). The MACS
	transforms these invisible mental processes into tangible, discussable
	elements, enabling clients to gain insights about their decision-making
	patterns and identify which mental activities are helping or hindering
	their progress.
</p>
<h4>
	Instructions</h4>
<p>
	<strong>Step 1: Introduction and Exploration (15-20 minutes)</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		Present the 20 mental activity cards to your client
	</li>
	<li>
		Invite them to browse through the cards and select any that
		resonate with them
	</li>
	<li>
		Encourage deep discussion about each selected card:
	</li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>
			"Tell me about this mental activity - when do you notice
			yourself doing this?"
		</li>
		<li>
			"What's happening in your mind when you engage in this
			activity?"
		</li>
		<li>
			"Why do you think you find yourself doing this?"
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Note:</strong> Cards flip over to reveal definitions if
		clarification is needed
	</li>
	<li>
		Allow clients to spend as much time as they wish discussing each
		activity
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Step 2: Sorting Process (10-15 minutes)</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		Click "Start Sorting" to begin categorisation
	</li>
	<li>
		Ask clients to sort cards into three piles: <strong>Often</strong>
		, <strong>Sometimes</strong>, <strong>Never</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		Encourage discussion throughout the sorting process
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Helpful prompts:</h4>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		"What surprises you about where this card landed?"
	</li>
	<li>
		"Tell me about the cards in your 'Often' pile - what do you
		notice?"
	</li>
	<li>
		"Are there any cards you wish were in a different pile?"
	</li>
	<li>
		"What patterns do you see emerging?"
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Step 3: Identifying Productive vs. Unproductive Activities (15-20
		minutes)
	</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		Ask clients to identify which activities feel most
		<strong>
			productive
		</strong>
		for their decision-making
	</li>
	<li>
		Explore which activities feel <strong>unproductive</strong> or
		unhelpful
	</li>
	<li>
		Facilitate reflection on why certain activities help or hinder
		their progress
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Key discussion points:</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		"Which of these activities move you toward clarity and action?"
	</li>
	<li>
		"Which ones seem to keep you stuck or increase your stress?"
	</li>
	<li>
		"How might you recognise when you're engaging in unproductive
		mental activities?"
	</li>
	<li>
		"What would it look like to engage more with the productive
		activities?"
	</li>
	<li>
		What are some specific, practical steps you could take this week
		to intentionally engage more in your productive mental activities?
	</li>
</ul>

	<li>
		"That absolutely looks like my brain. Just like, a million tabs
		open at once" (Harriet).
	</li>
	<li>
		"It's been useful to have it all as a visual, rather than just
		that playing in my head"(Maxine).

</ul>
<p>
	<strong><em>On Gaining Insights:</em></strong> <em></em>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		"Just having someone else break down my own inner dialogue,
		because it can be quite chaotic up in there. So to have someone go
		'Do you think that's because of this?' is really helpful. It's
		really helpful" (Harriet).
	</li>
	<li>
		"This is awesome actually. The main thing that surprised me is how
		much we think in our head" (Evelyn).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong><em>On Finding Direction:</em></strong> <em></em>
</p>
<ul type="disc">

		home and go, okay, well, we want to do study and this is why I
		want to do it and what's going to happen" (Laura).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong><em>On Reducing Isolation and Structural Awareness:</em></strong>
	<em></em>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>

		other mums or carers out there that are like having the same
		questions because the system is not really set up to support us in
		that'" (Faith).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong><em>On Shared Understanding:</em></strong> <em></em>
</p>
<ul type="disc">

		share it" (Lucia).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Key Counsellor Notes</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		The categorisation itself is less important than the reflections
		it generates
	</li>
	<li>
		Allow for spontaneous, open discussion - follow the client's lead
	</li>
	<li>
		Each client's pattern will be unique - avoid assuming typical
		responses
	</li>
	<li>
		Focus on the client's subjective experience and interpretations
	</li>
	<li>
		This tool works particularly well for clients facing complex life
		decisions
	</li>
	<li>
		The visual and tactile nature of the activity often reveals
		insights that verbal processing alone cannot achieve
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<em>
		Remember: This is about putting internal conversations "on the table"
		to make them visible and workable rather than keeping them trapped in
		the client's head.
	</em>
